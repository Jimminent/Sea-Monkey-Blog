                    Hello!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I just learned about Valentine's Day from the Big Thing (He was telling the Small Thing about it). What a neat mating ritual! Certainly seems a little odd to me, though. I mean, the idea that you have to plan big meetings? Or give gifts? Or create artistic expressions of love? <em>Or even talk to each other?</em> Gosh, that's quite a lot to worry about!
                </p>

                <p>
                    And you don't even know if you'll mate by the end. Talk about risky!
                </p>

                <p>
                    For sea monkeys, mating is a little different. It's very minimal. We just swim around together for a while! It doesn't matter for how long; it can be anywhere from a few hours to a few days. But there's nothing special to it! No heartfelt displays or anything like that Big Thing stuff. The male sea monkey just latches on to the underside of the female sea monkey using his head antennae, and that's it:

                <p>
                    There's a nice simplicity to it. But then again, my whole world is only a few cubic inches, so I might be biased.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Oh! I guess this is a good time to talk about the difference between a male and a female sea monkey.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, a male sea monkey, like Water Bottle, will have these big antennae on the top of his head. They almost look like flat horns that swoop backwards. And a female sea monkey will have an egg sac on either side of her mid section. That's the part that the male sea monkey latches onto.

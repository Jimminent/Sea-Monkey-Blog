                <p>Hi! My name is Kin. I'm a second-generation hatchling.</p>

                <p>I have at least 20 brothers and sisters! But I've counted up to 30 before. It's hard to tell because we all sort of hatched at the same time, and nobody ever stops moving around. Also, a lot of us have the same, monosylabic names. I'm Kin #1 though, so I just go by Kin.</p>

                <p>I swim pretty fast, but not as fast as Water Bottle. He's my dad I think. There are a couple of adult males in our tank, but he's the oldest. I never met my mom, Namey. Water Bottle said she died just before we all hatched. Luckily, sea monkeys are very good at having babies! If a pregnant sea monkey dies, she releases her eggs, and they can still hatch.</p>

                <p>Water bottle says that in a couple weeks, I'll be as big as he is and know if I'm a boy or a girl! Right now we hatchlings all look the same. That's partly because we're so small, but also because we're not fully developed. I have a lot of legs and two more eyes left to go before I look like a grown-up.</p>

                <p>Anyway, this is the tank!</p>

                <img class="article-image" src="../media/photos/tankZoomed.jpg" alt="Tank Interior">
                    
                <p>I think it's nice. It's pretty huge! It's so big that you can barely see me in this picture (I'm the speck in the top-middle). I've gone hours without hitting a single wall before. There's also a little mound at the bottom with a hole in the middle, and sometimes we play around there. But mostly my brothers and sisters and I like to swim up to the sun. It hangs on a silver stick, just above the waterline by the back wall. It shines a lot, but sometimes it goes dark and I don't mind that.</p>

                <p>Something else that's kind of neat is when the Big Thing comes over and blows bubbles in our tank. It does this 3 times a day.</p>
                    
                <p>The Big Thing is too weird to describe. It's bigger than the tank and its movements shake the water. The Big Thing is also <em>not</em> see-through at all. So weird! But Water Bottle says it feeds us, so it must be nice. I think it might be God.</p>

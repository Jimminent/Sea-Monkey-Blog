# About the Sea-Monkey-Blog
As a standard rule, this repository has two permanent branches:
"main" -- all work should be done here.
"live" -- this branch is published on GitHub Pages and is regularly behind main. The live branch is only updated via merging from main as updates become ready for publishing.
I chose to set this rule because, as the sole contributor to this repository, it is easier for me to treat main as a workstation than a publishing platform. I only need to update the live website once every week or two. If I ever need to work on an experimental feature, I can create another branch.

I built this website in order to cement my knowledge of HTML and CSS 
after a web development course at Western Governor's University. 
I loved learning about the fundamentals, but I felt like I would lose 
the skills if I never practiced. 

Since it was a course focused exclusively on HTML and CSS, I made a 
personal commitment to develop this entire site without JavaScript. 
I know enough JavaScript already to use it effectively, but I wanted 
to challenge myself with the the mobile dropdown menu, which is 
completely JavaScript-free (it took some research and a LOT of trial 
and error). All-in-all, it was a fun challenge! 

A quick explanation for my commits:
I have a terrible daily schedule. Monday through Friday I am up from 
8am to 3am the next day, being a full-time father during the day and 
working a night job from 5:30pm to 2am. It is only after my shift 
that I have the time to focus on this project. I often work until I 
can't stay awake, and that is when I usually forget to commit as 
often, resulting in awkward/bulk commits. My goal is always to 
make each commit atomic.

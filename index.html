    <!--
     
    possible options for homepage:
     1. Just the most recent blog post
     2. A page with recent article snapshot(s) on it 
     3. A very generic homepage with the menu button 
        items taking up the body, plus most recent article.

     I like option 2 because it seems like there's more 
     personality to it, and also more to showcase my 
     web skills...

     But I also like option 1 a little because of how it 
     just catapults the visitor into the content...
